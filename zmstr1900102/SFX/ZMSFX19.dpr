// Changes RCV:
// Jan. 10, 1999  Adapted for D4 beta v0.99f=now v1.60
// Feb. 10, 1999  Changed the Initialization and Finalization sections
//                to include file close and CRC table.
//                ( The Crc table was not freed after an Halt. )
// Jun. 15, 2000  Added code to Dialog.pas to free a pidl, bug found by
//                Lucjan Lukasik
// Sep. 01, 2000  Added version Checked for Delphi 5 and BCB 4 and 5
// Oct. 09, 2000  Added DirExists to the function FileExists because
//                FindFirstFile does not work when there is no file on
//                a drive (e.g. an empty 'A' drive) extract to that drive
//                would not work, found by Clyde England clyde@conres.com.au

// changes mst:
// apr 2002       almost completely rewritten (or better re-cut'n'pasted...)
//                - moved routines/types/variables to appropriate units
//                - added progress bar, ability to (initially) hide the files listview
//                - removed "new directory" handling (this is handled by newer windows' themselves)
//                - added the ability to expand environment variables
//                - uses a new sfxheader instead of the MPV header; it's now a pascal record
//                - added the ability to interrupt extraction (by pressing the "X" in the caption bar)
// may 01, 2002   added the GetExeSize function from Angus Johnson's TZip-SFX to get rid of
//                caring about the executable's size
// further changes: see history.txt in the ..\doc\ directory

{ Notes:

the initial release of zipsfx comes from Carl Bunton (see above).

the first modifications came from Eric W. Engler, the author of the great freeware
delphi-vcl delzip that can handle zip-archives and -sfx's. (EEngler@zcsterling.com)

original zip-code comes from the infozip-group, they developped a free implementation
of the zip/unzip-code for unix and later for other platforms.

  (* the structure of a zipsfx-file :

  - zipsfx-executable code (0-xxxxx)
