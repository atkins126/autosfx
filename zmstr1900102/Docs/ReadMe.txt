                     DLL Source Code in C 
            
        The DLL source code is distributed separately due to it's
     size, and the fact that most Delphi users of this package
     probably don't want the C source for the DLL's.  The DLL 
     source is also freeware, and will remain that way. 
     The DLL source code needs Borland C++ Builder v5 - v6.
